# DreamWorks Animation - Challenge

DreamWorks Animation Effects Challenge on HackerEarth

## Description of Challenge
You will need to use your coding ability to create ‘sparks’. You are provided with some models / assets, a reference scene and a rough sketch for visual direction. You can start with the reference scene and its coding language or create your own from scratch in your language of choice. You are not allowed to use any physics/collision engines such as Bullet, unity, unreal etc. You essentially have to write code for the mathematics (external vector/math library allowed) and physics (external library not allowed as mentioned above) of the motion of the sparks.

###Various Levels of Complexities:
- [x] L0: Basic natural motion of sparks.
- [x] L1: Collision with ground plane
- [x] L2: Sparks should split randomly post collision to give variation.
- [x] L3: Collision with a minimum of one of the given primitive shapes (sphere, cone, cube).
- [x] L4: Collision with the ‘Stanford Bunny’.

## How to Run :question:
